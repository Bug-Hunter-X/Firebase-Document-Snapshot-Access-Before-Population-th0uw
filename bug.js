The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has been fully populated. This can happen if you try to access the data in a callback function that is executed before the data has been loaded. This can lead to unexpected behavior. For example, if you try to access a property of the document before the data has been loaded, you may get an error.
